# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Your answer:
Comparitve  and Logical operators.

Researched answer:
Boolean expressions use relational and logical operators. The result of a Boolean expression is either true or false. Boolean expressions allow us to write programs that decide whether to execute some code or not.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:
An index is the position of a value, a value is any character.

Researched answer:
The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression match within a string.n a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called values. Though all values are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on. To create a value, you must merely invoke its name.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
They are similar in the way characters (letters, numbers, punctuations, etc) can be stored within them. They are different by how they store those characters. The string of '5' at the [0] will not === 5 but an array of [5] at the [0] will === 0.

Researched answer:
The key difference between Array and String is that an Array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, while a String is a collection of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
There is a driver and a navigator. The driver has their hands on the keyboard recieveing the info from the navigator on what to type. The navigator instructs the driver on what they should type.

Researched answer:
Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
